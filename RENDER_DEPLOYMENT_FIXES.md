# Render Deployment Fixes for AI Rule Intelligence Platform

This document summarizes the changes made to fix version conflicts and deployment issues when deploying to Render.

## Issues Identified

1. **Version Conflicts**: Local development was using Python 3.13.7, but Render was configured for Python 3.11.0
2. **Missing Import Order Fix**: The main.py file had import order issues that caused the `NameError: name 'app' is not defined` error
3. **Unpinned Dependencies**: The requirements.txt file didn't specify exact versions, leading to compatibility issues
4. **Incomplete File**: The main.py file appeared to be incomplete or corrupted

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Created Fixed main.py File

Created a new [main_fixed.py](file://c:\Users\soham\Downloads\BLACKHOLE\main_fixed.py) file with proper import order:
- FastAPI app is defined first
- Other imports that depend on the app are placed after the app definition
- Conditional imports inside functions to avoid circular imports

### 2. Pinned Dependencies in requirements_render.txt

Created a new [requirements_render.txt](file://c:\Users\soham\Downloads\BLACKHOLE\requirements_render.txt) with specific, compatible versions:
- numpy==1.24.3
- pandas==2.0.3
- stable-baselines3[extra]==2.2.1
- langchain==0.1.16
- torch==2.2.1
- fastapi==0.104.1
- uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
- sqlalchemy==2.0.27
- And other specific versions

### 3. Added runtime.txt

Created a [runtime.txt](file://c:\Users\soham\Downloads\BLACKHOLE\runtime.txt) file to explicitly specify Python version:
```
python-3.11.0
```

### 4. Updated render.yaml

Updated [render.yaml](file://c:\Users\soham\Downloads\BLACKHOLE\render.yaml) to:
- Use the new requirements_render.txt file
- Use main_fixed.py instead of main.py

### 5. Updated start_server.py

Modified [start_server.py](file://c:\Users\soham\Downloads\BLACKHOLE\start_server.py) to:
- Import database_setup inside the function to avoid import issues
- Use main_fixed:app instead of main:app
- Add better error handling and traceback printing

## How to Deploy to Render

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Log in to Render and create a new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will automatically use the [render.yaml](file://c:\Users\soham\Downloads\BLACKHOLE\render.yaml) configuration
5. Add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the Render dashboard
6. Deploy the service

## Verification

After deployment, you can verify the service is running by accessing:
- Health check: `https://your-app-url.onrender.com/health`
- API docs: `https://your-app-url.onrender.com/docs`

## Additional Notes

1. Make sure to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in your Render dashboard
2. The application will automatically initialize the database on startup
3. The health check endpoint can be used for monitoring and uptime checks
4. All dependencies are now pinned to specific versions that are known to work together
5. Python version is explicitly set to 3.11.0 for compatibility
