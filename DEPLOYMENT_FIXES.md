# Deployment Fixes for AI Rule Intelligence Platform

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the deployment issue on Render where the error `NameError: name 'app' is not defined` was occurring.

## Issues Identified

1. **Import Order Problem**: The FastAPI [app](file://c:\Users\soham\Downloads\BLACKHOLE\app.py#L0-L82) variable was not being defined before some imports that were trying to use it during initialization.

2. **Database Initialization**: The application was not ensuring the database was properly initialized before starting the server.

3. **Deployment Configuration**: Missing proper deployment configuration for Render.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Import Order in `main.py`

Reorganized the imports in [main.py](file:///c:/Users/soham/Downloads/BLACKHOLE/main.py) to ensure the FastAPI [app](file://c:\Users\soham\Downloads\BLACKHOLE\app.py#L0-L82) is defined before importing other modules that might depend on it:

```python
# Moved app definition to the top, before other imports
app = FastAPI(...)

# Import these modules AFTER the app is defined to avoid circular imports
from mcp_client import MCPClient 
from main_pipeline import process_case_logic
from database_setup import Rule, Feedback, GeometryOutput
# ... other imports
```

### 2. Created `start_server.py` for Proper Initialization

Created a new startup script that ensures the database is initialized before starting the FastAPI server:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Startup script for the AI Rule Intelligence Platform.
This script ensures the database is initialized before starting the FastAPI server.
"""

import os
import sys
import subprocess
from database_setup import create_database

def main():
    # Ensure the database is created before starting the server
    print("Initializing database...")
    try:
        create_database()
        print("Database initialized successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error initializing database: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # Start the FastAPI server
    print("Starting FastAPI server...")
    try:
        # Get the port from environment variable or default to 8000
        port = os.environ.get("PORT", "8000")
        
        # Run uvicorn with the proper parameters
        subprocess.run([
            "uvicorn", 
            "main:app", 
            "--host", "0.0.0.0", 
            "--port", port
        ], check=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error starting server: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Server stopped by user.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 3. Added Health Check Endpoint

Added a simple health check endpoint to [main.py](file:///c:/Users/soham/Downloads/BLACKHOLE/main.py) for deployment verification:

```python
# Health check endpoint for deployment verification
@app.get("/health", summary="Health check endpoint")
def health_check():
    """Simple health check endpoint to verify the service is running."""
    return {"status": "healthy", "message": "AI Rule Intelligence Platform is running"}
```

### 4. Created `render.yaml` for Automatic Deployment

Created a Render configuration file for automatic deployment:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: ai-rule-intelligence-platform
    env: python
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    startCommand: "python start_server.py"
    envVars:
      - key: PYTHON_VERSION
        value: 3.11.0
```

### 5. Updated README.md with Deployment Instructions

Added a new section to the README with detailed deployment instructions for Render.

### 6. Created Verification Scripts

Created several scripts to verify deployment readiness:
- `check_requirements.py` - Checks if all required packages are installed
- `test_database.py` - Tests database initialization
- `verify_deployment.py` - Runs all checks to verify deployment readiness

## How to Deploy to Render

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Log in to [Render](https://render.com/)
3. Click "New Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub account and select this repository
5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and configure the service
6. Add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the Render dashboard
7. Click "Create Web Service"

## Verification

After deployment, you can verify the service is running by accessing:
- Health check: `https://your-app-url.onrender.com/health`
- API docs: `https://your-app-url.onrender.com/docs`

## Additional Notes

1. Make sure to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in your Render dashboard
2. The application will automatically initialize the database on startup
3. The health check endpoint can be used for monitoring and uptime checks
