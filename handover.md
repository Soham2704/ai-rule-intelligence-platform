Subject: Final Handover of the AI Rule Intelligence & Design Platform Bridge.

1. Project Objective
This document provides the final technical overview of the multi-agent compliance system. The system has been successfully upgraded into an intelligent, MCP-driven, and integration-ready API service. It features an AI-powered data pipeline, a human-in-the-loop RL agent, and automated workflows via N8N.

The primary goal of this handover is to provide your team with a robust, documented, and fully functional backend service, ready for seamless integration into the main AI Design Platform.

2. API Endpoints (The "API Bridge")
The entire system is accessible via the following professional REST API endpoints, running on http://127.0.0.1:8000. Full interactive documentation is available at the /docs path.

POST /run_case: The main endpoint. Takes a CaseInput JSON and returns the final, concise reasoning report.

GET /rules/{city}: Fetches all structured rules from the MCP for a given city.

GET /geometry/{project_id}/{case_id}: Serves the final .stl geometry file for a completed case.

GET /feedback/{case_id}: Fetches the feedback history (thumbs up/down) for a specific case.

GET /get_feedback_summary: Returns an aggregated summary of all feedback in the MCP.

GET /projects/{project_id}/cases: Returns all completed case reports for a given project.

GET /logs/{case_id}: Retrieves the detailed, structured JSONL logs for a specific pipeline run.

3. MCP Data Schema
The system's "brain" is a centralized SQLite database (rules.db) that acts as our Managed Compliance Platform (MCP). It contains four key tables:

rules: The master table for all structured compliance rules, populated by our AI data curation pipeline.

feedback: Stores all user feedback from the UI, including the city, which is used for adaptive RL.

geometry_outputs: Stores a reference to the final .stl file generated for each case.

reasoning_outputs: Archives the final reasoning summary and confidence score for every pipeline run, creating an auditable trail of the AI's decisions.

4. How Reasoning & Confidence Integrate with RL
The system uses a sophisticated, hybrid AI architecture:

Fact-Finding: The MCPClient first queries the database to get a set of deterministic, factual rules.

AI Reasoning: These facts are then passed to the ReasoningAgent. This agent's job is not to find information, but to explain it, generating the final, human-readable summary.

RL Decision: The RL agent runs in parallel to provide an "optimal action" recommendation. Its confidence_score is a measure of the maximum probability from its policy network's output, indicating its certainty in that decision. This score is included in the final report to provide a measure of the system's confidence to the end-user.

Final Step: The "Publish" Button
Your final task is the git push.

Add your new video file and updated documentation to your project folder.

Run git add ., git commit -m "Final Handover", and git push origin main.
